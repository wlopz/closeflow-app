# CloseFlow Desktop App

A native macOS desktop application that integrates with the CloseFlow web app to provide seamless Zoom meeting detection and call analysis.

## Features

- **Zoom Meeting Detection**: Automatically detects when you're in an active Zoom meeting
- **Audio Device Management**: Select and monitor input/output devices with live level indicators
- **One-Click Call Analysis**: Start call analysis directly from the desktop app
- **Web App Integration**: Communicates with your web app via WebSocket for seamless data flow
- **System Tray Integration**: Runs in background with quick access from menu bar
- **Native macOS Experience**: Beautiful glassmorphism UI that feels native to macOS
- **Environment-Aware**: Automatically configures for development or production environments

## Prerequisites

- macOS 10.14 or later
- Node.js 16 or later
- CloseFlow web app running (localhost for development, or deployed URL for production)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the desktop app folder**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd desktop-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Grant necessary permissions:**
   - Microphone access (for audio monitoring)
   - Screen recording permission (for Zoom detection)
   - Accessibility permissions (for AppleScript automation)

## Development

### Run in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This automatically sets the web app URL to `http://localhost:3000` and starts the desktop app in development mode.

### Environment Configuration

The desktop app automatically configures the web app URL based on the environment:

#### Development (Default)
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Usage**: `npm run dev`
- **Environment Variable**: Automatically set by the dev script

#### Production
- **URL**: Set via `CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL` environment variable
- **Usage**: Set the environment variable before building or running
- **Example**: 
  ```bash
  export CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
  npm start
  ```

#### Manual Override
You can also override the URL using a command line argument:
```bash
electron . --web-app-url=https://custom-domain.com
```

### Build for distribution:

#### Development Build
```bash
npm run build:mac
```

#### Production Build
```bash
export CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
npm run build:production
```

This will create a DMG file in the `dist` folder with the production web app URL embedded.

## Usage

1. **Start the desktop app**
2. **Ensure your CloseFlow web app is running** 
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Production: Your deployed Netlify URL
3. **Join a Zoom meeting** - the app will automatically detect it
4. **Select your audio devices** from the dropdown menus
5. **Click "Start Analysis"** when ready to begin call analysis
6. **Monitor the web app** for real-time transcription and AI insights
7. **Click "Stop Analysis"** when the call is complete

## Environment Variables

### `CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL`
- **Purpose**: Sets the URL of the CloseFlow web application
- **Development**: Automatically set to `http://localhost:3000` by the dev script
- **Production**: Must be set to your deployed web app URL
- **Example**: `https://your-closeflow-app.netlify.app`

### Setting Environment Variables

#### For Development
The `npm run dev` script automatically sets the correct URL:
```bash
npm run dev  # Automatically uses http://localhost:3000
```

#### For Production Builds
Set the environment variable before building:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
export CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
npm run build:production

# Windows
set CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
npm run build:production
```

#### For Production Runtime
If you're distributing the app and want users to configure their own URL:
```bash
export CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
./CloseFlow.app/Contents/MacOS/CloseFlow
```

## Architecture

### Main Process (`src/main.js`)
- Handles Zoom detection using AppleScript and process monitoring
- Manages audio device enumeration and monitoring
- Establishes WebSocket connection to web app
- Handles system tray and window management
- **NEW**: Dynamic web app URL configuration based on environment

### Renderer Process (`src/renderer/`)
- Beautiful native UI with glassmorphism design
- Real-time status updates and audio level visualization
- User interaction handling and device selection
- Notification system for user feedback

### Web App Integration
- WebSocket communication on port 8080 (always localhost for the internal server)
- HTTP communication with web app at configured URL
- Real-time synchronization of call status
- Automatic triggering of web app call analysis
- Bidirectional messaging for insights and status updates

## Configuration Examples

### Development Setup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start web app
cd /path/to/closeflow-web-app
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2: Start desktop app
cd /path/to/closeflow-web-app/desktop-app
npm run dev  # Automatically connects to http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Setup
```bash
# Set your deployed web app URL
export CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL=https://my-closeflow-app.netlify.app

# Start the desktop app
npm start

# Or build for distribution
npm run build:production
```

### Netlify Deployment Integration
When deploying to Netlify, you can set the environment variable in your build settings:
- **Variable Name**: `CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL`
- **Value**: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Development**: Ensure the web app is running on `http://localhost:3000`
- **Production**: Verify the `CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL` environment variable is set correctly
- Check the desktop app logs for the configured web app URL
- Verify the web app is accessible from your browser at the configured URL

### Environment Variable Issues
- Check that the environment variable is set: `echo $CLOSEFLOW_WEB_APP_URL`
- Restart the desktop app after changing environment variables
- For production builds, ensure the variable is set during the build process

### URL Configuration Debug
The desktop app logs the configured web app URL on startup:
```
üåê ENHANCED LOGGING: Web app URL configured as: https://your-app.netlify.app
```

Check the console output to verify the correct URL is being used.

## Security

The app includes proper entitlements for macOS security:
- Microphone access for audio monitoring
- Network access for WebSocket and HTTP communication with web app
- AppleScript automation for Zoom detection

All permissions are declared in `entitlements.mac.plist` and will be properly signed when building for distribution.

## Future Enhancements

- Windows support
- Multiple meeting platform support (Teams, Google Meet, etc.)
- Advanced audio processing and noise cancellation
- Custom hotkeys and shortcuts
- Meeting recording integration
- Team collaboration features
- Automatic web app URL discovery
